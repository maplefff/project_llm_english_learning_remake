'Is doing' suggests it's happening now, but the sentence implies it's finished or ongoing, so 'has done' (present perfect) or 'did' (past simple) are better options.

      "explanation_of_Question": "This text has run-on sentences and punctuation issues. The first two clauses need proper separation (e.g., semicolon or new sentence). 'Which' should be 'that' or omitted in a restrictive clause. 'In' is not the correct preposition with 'arrive home'; no preposition is needed.
