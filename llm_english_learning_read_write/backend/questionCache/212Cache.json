      "explanation_of_Question": "This text has run-on sentences and punctuation issues. The first two clauses need proper separation (e.g., semicolon or new sentence). 'Which' should be 'that' or omitted in a restrictive clause. 'In' is not the correct preposition with 'arrive home'; no preposition is needed. 'Very exciting' should be 'really exciting' or similar, as 'so' usually introduces a consequence clause.",

      "explanation_of_Question": "'Child' is singular, but 'were' is plural; it should be 'child was'. 'Run' is incorrect for talking about a company; 'operate' or 'manage' is more appropriate. 'Last year' indicates past tense, so 'operate' should be 'operated'. 'Many' is used with countable nouns; 'a lot of' or 'much' would be better for 'money', but 'invested significantly' or similar might be better phrasing.",

'Look forward to meet' requires the -ing form after 'to' when 'to' is a preposition expressing a destination or object (here, the object of the anticipation), so it should be 'looking forward to meeting'.",
