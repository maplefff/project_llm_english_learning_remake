      "passage": "For weeks, Sarah had been uncharacteristically quiet about her plans. She had mentioned looking forward to a summer holiday for months, but suddenly, the topic was off-limits. Her friends noticed she started bringing packed lunches to work instead of joining them at the nearby cafe. Weekend shopping trips, once a regular occurrence, became non-existent. When someone suggested a night out, she'd politely decline, citing being 'a bit busy' or 'not feeling up to it,' though she seemed perfectly fine otherwise. She was also seen spending more time reviewing her bank statements and budget spreadsheets at home. A usually spontaneous and carefree person, her recent behavior suggested a new, cautious approach to spending.",

      "passage": "Liz was known for her sharp wit and insightful comments during team meetings, yet outside of the office, she was rarely seen. Invitations to company happy hours or weekend get-togethers would often be met with a polite 'maybe' that rarely materialized into an appearance. When she did attend, she would often stand near the edges of the room, engaging briefly if approached directly, but generally remaining quiet. She seemed visibly uncomfortable when the crowd grew larger or the noise level rose. However, in smaller groups of two or three or during one-on-one lunches, she was engaging, funny, and relaxed. This stark difference in behavior between intimate settings and larger social events was quite noticeable to those who knew her.",

      "passage": "The university library, a grand old building, was often quiet, perhaps too quiet. Students frequently complained about the difficulty in finding required texts for their courses; many popular titles were constantly checked out with long waiting lists, making timely access nearly impossible for large classes. The collection of academic journals, while extensive in some areas, was notably outdated in others, particularly in rapidly evolving scientific fields. Visiting scholars and researchers, while appreciating the historical archives, often noted that the current research materials were less comprehensive than expected for an institution of this size. Librarians were friendly and helpful, doing their best with interlibrary loans, but the core issue seemed persistent. The building itself was beautiful, but the shelves sometimes felt sparse for the number of students it served.",

Now, the lights in his office were often the last to turn off, with him staying late almost every evening and frequently working weekends. His colleagues noticed he was visibly exhausted, his usual cheerful demeanor replaced by a constant look of concentration and stress. He rarely spoke about his work with his usual enthusiasm, instead seemed burdened by it. Conversations with him became brief and focused, unlike the leisurely chats they used to have. His performance reviews were adequate, but the spark that defined his previous work seemed diminished, replaced by sheer persistence.",
