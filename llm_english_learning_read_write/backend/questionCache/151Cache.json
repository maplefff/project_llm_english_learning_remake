      "explanation_of_Question": "這段文章暗示了莎拉的行為是由於她對演講的焦慮。線索包括：她提前抵達演講廳（『早了半小時』）、她頻繁地檢查筆記（『一遍又一遍地翻閱著』）、她對每個迎面而來的人都擠出微笑（『勉強對每一個經過或與她眼神接觸的人微笑』），以及她提到她討厭公開演講。這些都是焦慮的典型表現。選項A和D沒有文中根據；選項C可能部分正確，但焦慮是更直接、全面的解釋。",

      "passage": "Sarah arrived at the auditorium half an hour before her presentation was scheduled to begin. She found an empty seat near the back and immediately pulled out her notes, flipping through them一遍又一遍地. Her hands trembled slightly as she held the papers. Every time someone entered the room, she would look up, offering a勉强对每一个经过或与她眼神接触的人微笑 that didn't quite reach her eyes. She kept glancing at the clock, then back at her notes. 'I really hate public speaking,' she muttered softly to herself, unaware that her microphone was already live, albeit at a low volume. Her palms felt sweaty, and she subtly wiped them on her skirt. The room slowly filled with people, and the ambient noise rose, but Sarah remained engrossed in her self-review, her eyes scanning the familiar words as if seeing them for the first time.",

      "passage": "Alice woke up before dawn, the sky outside still a deep navy blue. She quickly dressed in layers, grabbed the sign she had stayed up late painting the night before, and headed out into the crisp morning air. At the meeting point, a diverse crowd was already gathering, banners unfurling in the gentle breeze. Alice found a spot near the front, carefully unrolling her own banner and checking the carefully finished details. She listened intently to the organizers, nodding along and occasionally exchanging a determined glance with the strangers beside her. A sense of anticipation, a mixture of nervousness and hope, burned in her chest. She saw the same resolution reflected in the eyes of many around her. This wasn't just an event; it felt like a necessary stand, a collective voice rising. The first chants began to ripple through the crowd, and Alice felt a surge of belonging.",

      "passage": "Maria stood awkwardly in the doorway of Ethan's apartment, a space that once felt so familiar and welcoming. It used to be filled with warmth and laughter, but now it felt empty and silent, save for the soft hum of the refrigerator. Ethan was in the living room, packing a few boxes, his movements stiff and deliberate. Their conversation, once easy and flowing, was now limited to brief, polite exchanges about logistics. They avoided eye contact, and each word seemed carefully chosen, measured to avoid sparking any unintended emotion. Maria spotted a few books on a shelf that used to reside on their shared bookshelf back at her place; she walked over and picked them up, a small ache in her chest. The air between them was thick with unspoken words and unresolved feelings, a heavy silence that spoke volumes about the distance that had grown.",

      "passage": "The controversial downtown redevelopment project had faced stiff opposition from city residents and several council members for months. Public hearings were packed, voices raised in protest against the demolition of historic buildings and the proposed towering structures. The developers initially adopted a confrontational stance, dismissing community concerns. However, in the past few weeks, their strategy shifted dramatically. They began aggressively lobbying council members, hosting private dinners at exclusive restaurants, and making substantial donations to several council members' re-election campaigns. Suddenly, council members who were once vocal critics started expressing ' newfound appreciation' for the project's 'economic benefits.' At the last council meeting, the vote, which was widely expected to fail, passed by a narrow margin, with several key members unexpectedly switching their votes.",

Her mother's voice called from the kitchen, 'Is that you, dear? How was your day?' but Emma didn't reply, or perhaps she didn't hear. She reached her bedroom door, turned the handle, and stepped inside, closing it softly behind her. She leaned back against the door, eyes closed, taking a long, shaky breath. Her face was etched with a weariness that went beyond physical exhaustion. Sliding down the door until she was sitting on the floor, she rested her head on her knees. A quiet sob escaped her lips, quickly muffled by her hands. The backpack slid from her shoulder with a thud, but she didn't react, lost in her own silent struggle.",
