      "passage": "The marketing department has been working around the clock for the past month, with employees staying late and working weekends. Despite their exhaustive efforts to boost sales through various campaigns, the quarterly report shows declining numbers across all product lines. Several senior executives have been holding closed-door meetings, and there's been unusual activity in the HR department.

As the meal progressed, Sarah decided to share her recent good news: a significant promotion and an impending move to a new city for the job. She finished speaking, expecting congratulations. Instead, a noticeable silence fell over the table. Smiles faltered, and several people exchanged quick, unreadable glances before offering hesitant, muted well wishes.

People of all ages would gather there, not just to borrow books, but for study groups, children's story time, and local history talks. It was a place where connections were made and knowledge was shared freely. Nowadays, you hear very little mention of the library. The doors are still open, but the paint is peeling, and the garden outside is overgrown. Parking spaces that were once hard to find are now consistently empty throughout the day. The vibrant energy that once pulsed within its walls seems to have faded.",

His initial assignments were submitted on time and received good grades. However, as the weeks passed, a change became apparent. He started arriving late to class, sometimes missing them altogether. His once-neat notes became sparse, and assignment deadlines were often missed or required extensions. By the final exams, Ethan looked exhausted, and his grades reflected a significant decline from his initial performance.",

The average price of property has skyrocketed, making it increasingly difficult for families who have lived here for generations to afford to stay. Many familiar small businesses have closed, replaced by upscale boutiques and cafes catering to a different clientele. The newcomers are polite, but they don't seem to know the names of the long-time residents or show much interest in the annual block party that used to be the highlight of the summer. The feeling of a close-knit community is slowly eroding.",
