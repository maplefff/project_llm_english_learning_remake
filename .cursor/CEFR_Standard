CEFR Overview

The CEFR’s three main user levels are Basic User (A1, A2), Independent User (B1, B2), and Proficient User (C1, C2), providing non-specialists with an easily understood global reference point.
At its core, the framework employs “Can‐do” descriptors, starting from communicative activities—listening, speaking, reading, and writing—and specifically detailing the tasks and operations learners can competently perform in various contexts.
