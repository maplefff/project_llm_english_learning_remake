# Project Structure and Model Selection Rule

## Project Paths

- Write&Read Project Root(閱讀寫作專案根目錄): `/Users/wu_cheng_yan/cursor/project_llm_english_learning_remake/llm_english_learning_remake`
- Project father(專案父目錄):`/Users/wu_cheng_yan/cursor/project_llm_english_learning_remake`

## Gemini Model Selection

- **Selected LLM Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`
- **Reason**: User directive.
- **Note**: This model selection is final and should not be changed without explicit user instruction. All development should target this model for LLM-based generation tasks. 

## Directory Structure Rule

- **Directory Structure Synchronization**: The project's directory structure is outlined in `devPlanRead&Write.md`. Any significant changes to the actual directory structure (e.g., adding, removing, renaming top-level folders or key service folders) **must** be reflected by updating the corresponding section in `devPlanRead&Write.md` to maintain documentation consistency.
